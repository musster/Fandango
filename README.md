It is a common practice for many people to have a look (at least a quick one) at the movie ratings (or reviews) on various platforms if they are planning to go out to see a movie hoping this will help them to avoid wasting time and money.

But what if the reviews are biased? This could become even a bigger concern in the case that the same company showing the rating *also* makes money by selling movie tickets. Wouldn't that grow a possible conflict of interest?

In 2015, fivethirtyeight (also known as 538, an American website famous for opinion poll analysis, politics and sports analysis and statistics) published an article regarding Fandango's movie ratings. Fandango is a ticketing company in US and they sell movie tickets via their website [fandango.com](http://fandango.com). In addition to selling tickets, they also provide rating of the movies for which they are selling the tickets. 

According to the article of fivethirtyeight, it is nearly impossible for a movie to "fail" by Fandango standards (stars) and the average rating of a movie on Fandango is much higher compared to other movie rating websites (such as IMDB). Whats more, there seems a significant difference between the ratings - which are embedded in HTLM code of the website - and the stars which are actually displayed on the mainpage of the website. The disparity seems significant enough to call it more than an innocent error.

In this project, I will be using the data which has been scraped by fivethirtyeight to see I am able to reach the same results as claimed. In Part Two of the study, the difference between ratings and stars on Fandango website will be evaluated and in Part Four, the comparison between Fandango and other movie rating websites will be made.
